# Prodigy Infotech Project 3 â€“ Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

This project is part of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It focuses on building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Objective
To apply a machine learning classification model (Decision Tree) on a real-world dataset and analyze customer purchase behavior in a bank marketing campaign.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Bank Marketing Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **File used:** `train2.csv`
- **Target column:** `y` (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import**
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Viewed basic structure using `.head()` and `.info()`

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets

5. **Model Training**
   - Trained a `DecisionTreeClassifier` with a max depth of 4

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy score

7. **Visualization**
   - (Add tree plot or performance chart here, if included)

## Learning Outcome
This project enhanced my understanding of supervised learning, preprocessing real-world categorical data, and how decision trees can be applied to customer behavior classification problems.

## Status
Project Completed
